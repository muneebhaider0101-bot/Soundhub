# SoundHub - ICT Semester Project 🎵

## Introduction
Welcome to **SoundHub**, our first-semester project for the Introduction to Computing Technologies (ICT) course. We set out to create a modern, immersive music discovery platform that looks and feels like a professional application.

**Group Members:**
*   Muhammd Muneeb Haider (25F-0740)
*   Ali Ammar Gill (25F-0522)
*   Muhammad Iltifat Qaiser (25F-0670)

## Project Overview
SoundHub is a web-based music player and discovery tool. We wanted to move away from boring, static websites and build something "alive." Our inspiration came from the "Glassmorphism" design trend and the dynamic interfaces seen in modern mobile apps.

### Key Features
*   **Dynamic Island Player:** A persistent music player that expands and collapses, inspired by modern UI designs. It allows you to control music playback from anywhere on the site.
*   **Bento Grid Layout:** We used CSS Grid to create a bento-style layout for the genre selection, making it visually interesting and responsive.
*   **"Void & Neon" Aesthetic:** We designed a custom dark mode theme with glowing neon accents and animated background orbs to create a "sonic" atmosphere.
*   **Real-Time Interactions:** The site features smooth transitions, hover effects, and a modal system for viewing artist details without leaving the page.

## Technologies Used
Since this is our first semester, we focused on mastering the core web technologies without using heavy frameworks:
*   **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the application.
*   **CSS3:** For all styling, including Flexbox, Grid, Keyframe animations, and custom variables.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla):** For all the logic, including the audio player, event listeners, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

## How It Works
1.  **File Structure:**
    *   `index.html`: The main entry point.
    *   `style.css`: Contains all the visual styles.
    *   `main.js`: Handles the logic (play/pause, modals, etc.).
    *   `data.js`: Acts as our "database," storing the song and artist information.

2.  **Challenges & Learnings:**
    *   **CSS Nesting:** We learned the hard way that keeping CSS organized is crucial! We had to debug some tricky nesting issues.
    *   **DOM Manipulation:** Connecting the "Play" buttons in the genre modal to the main player required careful JavaScript coding.
    *   **Responsive Design:** Making the "Dynamic Island" look good on different screen sizes was a fun challenge.

## Future Improvements
If we had more time, we would love to add:
*   A real backend to store user playlists.
*   More visualizations for the audio.
*   A search bar to find specific artists.
